# Pig-game with a twist (😉 to dont need to chnage players if you roll a 1)

Game begins with player 1 (active player)
When active player rolls dice the value gets added to the player's current roll
if the player rolls a die value of '1' the player loses all this current points

Players have to hold to preserve current score to avoid losing it when they roll a 1 and this changes the active player

first player to have a total score greater than 100 wins the game
